# BoolExpression

***This python program was created for educational purposes.***
It is able to read a bool expression, generate a truth table from that, and finaly reduce the input expression in the smallests expressions (one or more).
You can also indicate how much variable exist and say also what are the solution to set at one.

### Read Expression
The boolean expression is first splitted in fundamental parts (adding implicited multiplication) and after converted in a dictionary that il builded following the priority of brakets and of the multiplication
### Calculate
The expression converted to a dict, passed with the inputs into a function, generate the result. With this the program can generate the truth table.

## Generate smallest expression
Look [Quine–McCluskey algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm) and [Petrick's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrick%27s_method).
The algorithms are based on these principles and permitts the minimization of the expressions.
